Exploitation of this issue can have an unspecified impact on the integrity of PHP.
39	CVE-2017-11628	119		DoS Overflow	2017-07-25	2018-05-03	6.8	None	Remote	Medium	Not required	Partial	Partial	Partial	In PHP before 5.6.31, 7.x before 7.0.21, and 7.1.x before 7.1.7, a stack-based buffer overflow in the zend_ini_do_op() function in Zend/zend_ini_parser.c could cause a denial of service or potentially allow executing code. NOTE: this is only relevant for PHP applications that accept untrusted input (instead of the system's php.ini file) for the parse_ini_string or parse_ini_file function, e.g., a web application for syntax validation of php.ini directives.
40	CVE-2017-11362	119		DoS Overflow	2017-07-17	2019-05-22	7.5	None	Remote	Low	Not required	Partial	Partial	Partial	In PHP 7.x before 7.0.21 and 7.1.x before 7.1.7, ext/intl/msgformat/msgformat_parse.c does not restrict the locale length, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact within International Components for Unicode (ICU) for C/C++ via a long first argument to the msgfmt_parse_message function.

A heap out-of-bounds write or read occurs in next_state_val() during regular expression compilation. Octal numbers larger than 0xff are not handled correctly in fetch_token() and fetch_token_in_cc(). A malformed regular expression containing an octal number in the form of '\700' would produce an invalid code point value larger than 0xff in next_state_val(), resulting in an out-of-bounds write memory corruption.

145	CVE-2015-8994	264		+Priv	2017-03-02	2017-03-16	6.8	None	Remote	Medium	Not required	Partial	Partial	Partial	An issue was discovered in PHP 5.x and 7.x, when the configuration uses apache2handler/mod_php or php-fpm with OpCache enabled. With 5.x after 5.6.28 or 7.x after 7.0.13, the issue is resolved in a non-default configuration with the opcache.validate_permission=1 setting. The vulnerability details are as follows. In PHP SAPIs where PHP interpreters share a common parent process, Zend OpCache creates a shared memory object owned by the common parent during initialization. Child PHP processes inherit the SHM descriptor, using it to cache and retrieve compiled script bytecode ("opcode" in PHP jargon). Cache keys vary depending on configuration, but filename is a central key component, and compiled opcode can generally be run if a script's filename is known or can be guessed. Many common shared-hosting configurations change EUID in child processes to enforce privilege separation among hosted users (for example using mod_ruid2 for the Apache HTTP Server, or php-fpm user settings). In these scenarios, the default Zend OpCache behavior defeats script file permissions by sharing a single SHM cache among all child PHP processes. PHP scripts often contain sensitive information: Think of CMS configurations where reading or running another user's script usually means gaining privileges to the CMS database.

459	CVE-2007-1717				2007-03-27	2018-10-30	5.0	None	Remote	Low	Not required	None	Partial	None	The mail function in PHP 4.0.0 through 4.4.6 and 5.0.0 through 5.2.1 truncates e-mail messages at the first ASCIIZ ('\0') byte, which might allow context-dependent attackers to prevent intended information from being delivered in e-mail messages. NOTE: this issue might be security-relevant in cases when the trailing contents of e-mail messages are important, such as logging information or if the message is expected to be well-formed.

NOTE: it could be argued that this not a vulnerability in PHP itself, rather a design limitation that enables certain attacks against session handlers that do not account for this limitation.

NOTE: it could be argued that the ip2long behavior represents a risk for security-relevant issues in a way that is similar to strcpy's role in buffer overflows, in which case this would be a class of implementation bugs that would require separate CVE items for each PHP application that uses ip2long in a security-relevant manner.

NOTE: it could be argued that this is a class of technology-specific vulnerability, instead of a particular instance; if so, then this should not be included in CVE.

NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the Apache security team, saying "It is by design that PHP allows scripts to process any request method. A script which does not explicitly verify the request method will hence be processed as normal for arbitrary methods. It is therefore expected behaviour that one cannot implement per-method access control using the Apache configuration alone, which is the assumption made in this report."
